    "# Introduction 🌱\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook presents an example method used to model a presence raster, with a focus on the *Angiosperms* layer. This is just one approach, and while this notebook demonstrates my specific choice of the *Angiosperms* layer, other users may choose different layers based on their own objectives. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this *Steps* notebook, you will find a detailed walkthrough of each stage of the project. Each step is explained in its corresponding notebook, offering a clear, organized process for modeling that can be adapted to various layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 0: Choose Your Layer 🌍\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, I’ve chosen to model the *Angiosperms* layer. However, the process demonstrated here is flexible and can be adjusted for any layer you choose. To help you decide, you can explore and visualize the available layers using the following [Web Application for Layer Visualization](https://mistra-c2b2-symphony-layers-interactive-explorer-interface.streamlit.app/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The web application provides:\n",
    "- 📑 A **summary** of each layer. \n",
    "- 🛠️ **Recommendations for data improvement**, which serve as a guide to help you begin modeling the raster and provide useful starting points for your work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Select the layer that best fits your project needs and objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1 : Download Your Datasets 📥\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the **summary** and the **recommendation for data improvement** of the layer to dress a list of the relevant parameters for your layer. You can also search for studies of your subject. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Symphony Metadata Report (March 2019)](https://github.com/Mistra-C2B2/Symphony-Layers-Interactive-Explorer/blob/main/Symphony%20Metadata%20March%202019.pdf) recommends using additional environmental criteria such as *water depth*, *substrate salinity*, and *exposure* to model the Angiosperms probability of presence.  In addition, a study of the [distribution and co-occurrence patterns of charophytes and angiosperms in the northern Baltic Sea](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-47176-8) lists relevant parameters to create a model for Angiosperms plants. \n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to model the probability of presence of the *Zosteraceae* (a family of seagrasses) between 2015 and 2023. I have downloaded datasets of *Zosteraceae* locations in the Swedish marine area from [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org) and relevant datasets from the [Copernicus Marine Data Store](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/products). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the list of datasets I have downloaded: \n",
    "\n",
    "- 🌐 [Baltic Sea Physics Reanalysis](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/BALTICSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_003_011/description)\n",
    "- 🧪 [Baltic Sea Biogeochemistry Reanalysis](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/BALTICSEA_MULTIYEAR_BGC_003_012/description)\n",
    "- 🌊 [Baltic Sea Wave Hindcast](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/BALTICSEA_MULTIYEAR_WAV_003_015/description)\n",
    "- 🌱 [Artportalen](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/38b4c89f-584c-41bb-bd8f-cd1def33e92f)\n",

    "### Filtering and Downloading the Artportalen Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To filter the Artportalen dataset, in the **DOWNLOAD** section, you can use the simple filters and filter by:\n",
    "1. 🌱 **Scientific name**: Plantae > Liliopsida > Alismatales > Zosteraceae\n",
    "2. 📅 **Year**: 2015 - 2023\n",
    "3. 🗺️ **Location**: I click on \"Including coordinates\", and drew myself a rough geometry of the Baltic Sea including Skagerrak.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downloading Copernicus Marine Data \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways you can download data from the Copernicus Marine Data Store:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. 💻 Manual Download \n",
    "\n",
    "For the **Baltic Sea Physics Reanalysis** and **Baltic Sea Biogeochemistry Reanalysis**:\n",
    "1. Click on “Data access” and choose the desired time resolution (I selected Yearly).\n",
    "2. Download the datasets using the “From” or “Browse” buttons. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. 📡 Using the Python API \n",
    "\n",
    "For the **Baltic Sea Wave Hindcast** dataset, I used the Python API to download it programmatically, which is an efficient method for automating the process and handling large datasets. Since this dataset is available only in hourly resolution, I had to calculate the yearly mean to match the annual resolution of the other datasets.\n",
