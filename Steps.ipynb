    "You can use the [Web Application for visualization for the symphony layers](https://mistra-c2b2-symphony-layers-interactive-explorer-interface.streamlit.app/). You will find a **summary** and a **recommendation for data improvement** of each layer.\n",

    "The  [Symphony Metadata Report (March 2019)](https://github.com/Mistra-C2B2/Symphony-Layers-Interactive-Explorer/blob/main/Symphony%20Metadata%20March%202019.pdf) recommand to use additional environmental criteria such as *water depth*, *substrate salinity* and *exposure* to model the Angiosperms probability of presence. In addition, a study of the [distribution and co-occurrence patterns of charophytes and angiosperms in the northern Baltic Sea](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-47176-8) list relevant paramaters to create a model for Angiosperms plants.\n",
