    "In this Jupyter notebook, we will walk through a methodology to model the *probability of presence of Zosteraceae species* in the **Living Lab West** of Sweden, which includes the **Kattegat** and **Skagerrak** regions. Our primary objective is to predict the **suitability of these areas** for Zosteraceae and provide insights into their distribution, thereby aiding **marine spatial planning** decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zosteraceae, commonly known as **seagrasses**, are a family of **flowering plants** that thrive in **marine environments**. These plants are unique in that they are the only group of **flowering plants** fully adapted to live submerged in **saltwater**. Zosteraceae species, such as **Zostera marina** (eelgrass), are commonly found in **shallow coastal areas** across the globe, particularly in **estuaries**, **mangrove swamps**, and **seagrass meadows**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These plants play a pivotal role in **coastal ecosystems**. They are essential for:\n",
    "- **Biodiversity**: Providing habitat and food for various marine species.\n",
    "- **Carbon sequestration**: Acting as a carbon sink to help mitigate climate change.\n",
    "- **Ecosystem services**: Contributing to water filtration, sediment stabilization, and erosion control.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we aim to model and predict the **probability of Zosteraceae presence**, which can help with **marine conservation efforts** and **ecosystem management** in these regions.\n",

    "## Why Are We Building It?\n",

    "This notebook is created to support the **C2B2-Mistra Hackathon**, which will take place in **October 2025**. The focus of the hackathon is to improve the [**Symphony Tool**](https://www.havochvatten.se/en/eu-and-international/marine-spatial-planning/swedish-marine-spatial-planning/the-marine-spatial-planning-process/development-of-plan-proposals/symphony---a-tool-for-ecosystem-based-marine-spatial-planning.html), developed by the **Swedish Marine and Water Authority (SMWA)**. The **Symphony Tool** is instrumental in assessing **human pressures** on marine ecosystems and supporting **data-driven marine spatial planning**.\n",

    "\n",
    "During the hackathon, participants will work on enhancing the **Symphony Layers**, which represent key environmental data used in the tool. To assist them in identifying areas for improvement, I developed the [**Symphony Layers Interactive Explorer**](https://mistra-c2b2-symphony-layers-interactive-explorer-interface.streamlit.app/). This **Web Application for Data Visualization** provides an interactive and transparent overview of the data layers in the Symphony Tool.\n",

    "The web application offers:\n",
    "- üìë A **summary** of each layer, outlining its purpose and attributes.\n",

    "The ultimate aim of this notebook is to contribute to improving the **Angiosperms raster** by modeling the **presence probability of Zosteraceae** in this context, which can help inform future **marine spatial planning** and **conservation efforts**.\n",

    "# üõ†Ô∏è Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environmental Parameters for the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To build an effective model for the **probability of presence** of *Zosteraceae* in the **Living Lab West of Sweden**, I first identified the key environmental parameters that influence the distribution of these plants. This process was guided by both the **Symphony Metadata Report (March 2019)** and relevant scientific studies on angiosperms, particularly seagrasses like **Zostera marina**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Sources**:\n",
    "1. The **[Symphony Metadata Report (March 2019)](https://github.com/Mistra-C2B2/Symphony-Layers-Interactive-Explorer/blob/main/Symphony%20Metadata%20March%202019.pdf)** suggests additional environmental parameters such as **water depth**, **substrate salinity**, and **exposure**.\n",
    "2. A recent study on the **[distribution and co-occurrence patterns of charophytes and angiosperms in the northern Baltic Sea](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-47176-8)** lists several important environmental variables to model the distribution of **Angiosperms**, including **Zosteraceae**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these recommendations and the available environmental data, I compiled the following list of parameters essential for the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Water depth**\n",
    "- **Slope of seabed**\n",
    "- **Salinity**\n",
    "- **Wave exposure**\n",
    "- **Current velocity**\n",
    "- **Water temperature**\n",
    "- **Concentration of nitrates**\n",
    "- **Concentration of phosphates**\n",
    "- **Chlorophyll a content of the sea surface**\n",
    "- **Proportion of ice cover**\n",
    "- **Proportion of soft sediment**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the environmental parameters provide a good foundation, the most crucial input for this model is the **presence data of Zosteraceae species**. The **Zosteraceae observation dataset** I used comes from a large repository of plant observations. However, as it contains only **presence data** and not **absence points**, the **MaxEnt model** (a **presence-only model**) is the ideal choice for this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## MaxEnt Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**MaxEnt** (Maximum Entropy) is a widely-used **species distribution modeling (SDM)** system that predicts the **probability of species occurrence** based on **presence data** and **environmental variables**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **MaxEnt model** operates as a **presence-background model**:\n",
    "- **Presence data**: It uses observed occurrences of the species.\n",
    "- **Background data**: Instead of using absence data (where the species is not found), MaxEnt uses a random sample of points (the **background samples**) from the landscape where the species could potentially be found. \n",
    "\n",
    "The absence data is **not required**, which is why **MaxEnt** is particularly useful when working with **presence-only data** like the one we have for **Zosteraceae**. While this approach reduces data collection requirements, it also presents unique challenges in terms of fitting and interpreting the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further details on how the MaxEnt model works and how it's implemented in Python, refer to the documentation of the library I used:  \n",
    "üëâ [**elapid documentation**](https://earth-chris.github.io/elapid/sdm/maxent/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Available Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the **Symphony Layers Interactive Explorer**, I easily identified the necessary datasets to complete the model. These datasets include both **Zosteraceae presence data** and **environmental variables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Zosteraceae Observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "   I obtained the **Zosteraceae observation data** from the **Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)**, which provides a comprehensive dataset of species occurrences.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Environmental Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "   The environmental datasets were obtained from the **Copernicus Marine Data Store** and **EMODnet**. These datasets provide detailed environmental conditions such as temperature, salinity, exposure, and bathymetry, which are essential for modeling the habitat suitability of Zosteraceae.\n",
