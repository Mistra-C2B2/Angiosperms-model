    "In this Jupyter notebook, we will explore an example methodology to model *the probability of presence of the Zosteraceae species* in the Living Lab West of Sweden, which encompasses the Kattegat and Skagerrak regions. The goal is to predict the suitability of these areas for Zosteraceae, providing insights into their distribution and helping inform marine spatial planning decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Zosteraceae, commonly referred to as Zoster or seagrasses, is a family of flowering plants that grow in marine environments. These plants are unique because they are the only group of flowering plants adapted to live fully submerged in saltwater. They are found in shallow coastal areas around the world, typically in estuaries, mangrove swamps, and seagrass meadows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zosteraceae species, such as Zostera marina (eelgrass), play an important role in coastal ecosystems. These seagrasses are crucial for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and maintaining ecosystem services in marine environments.\n",

    "This Jupyter notebook is designed to support the first **C2B2-Mistra Hackaton** in **October 2025**. This hackathon focus on improving the [Symphony Tool](https://www.havochvatten.se/en/eu-and-international/marine-spatial-planning/swedish-marine-spatial-planning/the-marine-spatial-planning-process/development-of-plan-proposals/symphony---a-tool-for-ecosystem-based-marine-spatial-planning.html) developed by the Swedish Marine and Water Authority (SMWA). The **Symphony Tool** is instrumental in assessing human pressures on marine ecosystems, guiding data-driven marine spatial planning.\n",

    "In the hackathon participants participants will work on improving the **Symphony Layers**. To assist them in identifying areas for data improvement, I have developed the [Symphony Layers Interactive Explorer](https://mistra-c2b2-symphony-layers-interactive-explorer-interface.streamlit.app/). This **Web Application for Data Visualisation** provides a transparent and interactive overview of the data layers used within the Symphony Tool.\n",

    "## Environmental parameters of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the **summary** and the **recommendation for data improvement** of the *Angiosperms* layer and additional studies of angiosperms, I have dressed a list of the relevant parameters. The [Symphony Metadata Report (March 2019)](https://github.com/Mistra-C2B2/Symphony-Layers-Interactive-Explorer/blob/main/Symphony%20Metadata%20March%202019.pdf) recommends using additional environmental criteria such as *water depth*, *substrate salinity*, and *exposure* to model the Angiosperms probability of presence.  In addition, a study of the [distribution and co-occurrence patterns of charophytes and angiosperms in the northern Baltic Sea](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-47176-8) lists relevant parameters to create a model for Angiosperms plants. \n",

    "Most of all I need observations data of Zosteraceae species. The Zosteraceae point dataset I used is coming from a very big database of observations. However this means I don't have absence points. That's why the MaxEnt Model, a presence only model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MaxEnt model\n",
    "\n",
    "Maxent is a species distribution modeling (SDM) system that uses **species observations** and **environmental data** to predict where a species might be found under past, present or future environmental conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a presence/background model. Maxent uses data on where a species is present and, instead of data on where it is absent, it uses a random sample of the landscape where you might expect to find that species. This is convenient because it reduces data collection requirements, but it also introduces some unique challenges for fitting and interpreting models.\n",
